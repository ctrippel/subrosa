# subrosa

Subrosa is a tool for formally specifying leakage containment models (LCMs). It also provides automation to find leakage.

## Installation

No installation is needed! Just open the lcm_skeleton.als file in Alloy and execute it. If you want to visualize the results you can use lcm.thm to omit unnecessary edges. Alloy can be downloaded here: https://alloytools.org/download.html.
